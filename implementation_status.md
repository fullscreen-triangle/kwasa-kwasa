```rust
fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize environment
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    env_logger::init();
    
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    
    match cli.command {
        Commands::Run { script } => {
            run_script(&script)?;
        },
        Commands::Validate { script } => {
            validate_script(&script)?;
        },
        Commands::Process { document, interactive } => {
            process_document(&document, interactive)?;
        },
        Commands::Repl => {
            start_repl()?;
        },
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### src/turbulance/lexer.rs

The lexer is fully implemented with comprehensive token types:

```rust
#[derive(Logos, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum TokenKind {
    // Keywords
    #[token("funxn")]
    FunctionDecl,

    #[token("project")]
    ProjectDecl,

    // Many more tokens defined...

    // Error handling
    #[error]
    Error,
}
```

### src/turbulance/parser.rs

The parser implements a complete recursive descent parser for Turbulance:

```rust
impl Parser {
    pub fn parse(&mut self) -> Result<Node, TurbulanceError> {
        let mut statements = Vec::new();
        
        while !self.is_at_end() {
            statements.push(self.declaration()?);
        }
        
        // Create a span for the entire program
        let start_pos = if let Some(first_token) = self.tokens.first() {
            Position::new(0, 0, first_token.span.start)
        } else {
            Position::new(0, 0, 0)
        };
        
        let end_pos = if let Some(last_token) = self.tokens.last() {
            Position::new(0, 0, last_token.span.end)
        } else {
            Position::new(0, 0, 0)
        };
        
        let span = Span::new(start_pos, end_pos);
        
        Ok(ast::program(statements, span))

## Domain Expansion Plan

Building on Kwasa-kwasa's core philosophy of arbitrarily defined boundaries and semantic unit manipulation, we are expanding the framework to handle domains beyond traditional text processing:

### Genomic Sequence Analysis

The Turbulance language can be extended to provide powerful tools for genomic sequence analysis:

1. **Flexible boundary definition**: Allow defining units at multiple scales:
   - Genes
   - Exons/introns
   - Motifs
   - Codons
   - Individual nucleotides

2. **Contextual genomic processing**: Analyze sequences while preserving biological context

3. **Transformation pipelines for genomic operations**:
   ```turbulance
   dna_sequence |> 
     identify_coding_regions() |>
     filter_by_expression_level(threshold=0.8) |>
     align_with_reference_genome()
   ```

4. **Domain-specific genomic operations**:
   ```turbulance
   // Split sequence into motifs
   var regulatory_regions = sequence / "motif"
   
   // Recombine sequences
   var hybrid_sequence = sequence1 * sequence2
   
   // Add genetic elements
   var modified_gene = original_gene + promoter_sequence
   
   // Remove specific regions
   var truncated_sequence = full_sequence - repetitive_regions
   ```

5. **Propositions and motions for genetic relationships**:
   ```turbulance
   proposition GeneRegulation:
     motion Activation("Gene X activates Gene Y")
     motion Suppression("Gene Z suppresses Gene X")
   ```

### Pattern-Based Meaning Extraction

We're exploring extracting meaning from the fundamental structure of text itself:

1. **Grapheme pattern analysis**:
   ```turbulance
   within text as graphemes:
       identify_root_patterns()
       trace_etymological_history()
   ```

2. **Orthographic signature detection**:
   ```turbulance
   proposition TextFingerprint:
       motion LetterDistribution(calculate_frequency_signature(text))
       motion VisualDensity(analyze_whitespace_distribution(text))
   ```

3. **Statistical pattern significance**:
   ```turbulance
   var distinctive_patterns = text - expected_distribution
   var anomaly_score = measure_statistical_deviation(text)
   ```

4. **Sequence-agnostic manipulations**:
   ```turbulance
   // Process sequence based on pure structure without semantic interpretation
   processed_sequence = sequence.transform(n => n.position % 3 == 0 ? 'X' : n)
   var entropy = calculate_shannon_entropy(sequence)
   
   // Work with any arbitrary sequence type
   var reversed_units = sequence / 3  // Split into 3-character units
                             |> reverse_each()
                             |> join()
   ```

## Implementation Strategy for Domain Expansions

To implement these domain expansions, we'll take the following approach:

1. **Core Framework Abstraction**
   - Refactor text unit boundaries to handle arbitrary unit types
   - Develop a plugin system for domain-specific extensions
   - Create generic interface for unit operators (/, *, +, -)

2. **Genomic Analysis Extension**
   - Implement nucleotide and codon tokenization
   - Create genomic-specific operations library
   - Develop visualization components for genomic data

3. **Pattern Analysis Components**
   - Build statistical analysis tools for character distributions
   - Implement entropy and information density calculations
   - Create pattern matching algorithms for sequence anomalies

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Develop test cases with real genomic datasets
   - Benchmark against existing genomic analysis tools
   - Create examples demonstrating letter-pattern analysis

These expansions align with the core philosophy of Kwasa-kwasa by recognizing that the framework's power comes from its ability to manipulate arbitrarily defined units regardless of their semantic meaning to humans.

## Technical Challenges to Address

1. **Semantic Boundary Detection**
   - Current approach uses rule-based boundary detection, but may need to incorporate ML-based approaches for more accurate semantic boundaries
   - Challenge: Balancing accuracy with performance

2. **Text Operation Composition**
   - Need to ensure operations compose well and maintain semantic integrity
   - Challenge: Managing state between operations

3. **Interpreter Performance**
   - Need to optimize interpreter for large documents
   - Challenge: Efficient execution without sacrificing language features

4. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Need to design flexible API for accessing external knowledge
   - Challenge: Caching and privacy concerns

## Testing Strategy

The current testing approach uses unit tests for individual components. As implementation progresses, we need to:

1. **Expand Unit Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for all language features
   - Test edge cases in text operations
   - Test error handling

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction between components
   - Test complete workflows
   - Test with realistic documents

3. **Create Example Projects**
   - Implement the example projects from the README
   - Validate functionality with real-world use cases
