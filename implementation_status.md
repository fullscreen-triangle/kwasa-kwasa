### 2. CLI Framework

The CLI framework is fully implemented using Clap for argument parsing. The main commands are:

- `run`: Executes a Turbulance script
- `validate`: Validates a Turbulance script
- `process`: Processes a document with embedded Turbulance
- `repl`: Starts an interactive Turbulance shell

The implementation in `main.rs` includes proper error handling and command routing. Currently, some commands are placeholders that will be fully implemented as the rest of the system is completed.

### 3. Turbulance Language

#### 3.1 Lexer (✅ Complete)

The lexer uses the Logos crate for efficient tokenization and is fully implemented in `src/turbulance/lexer.rs`. It supports:

- Keywords: `funxn`, `within`, `given`, `project`, `ensure`, `return`, etc.
- Operators: Division (`/`), Multiplication (`*`), Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), etc.
- Delimiters: Parentheses, braces, brackets, etc.
- Literals: Strings, numbers
- Identifiers and comments

The lexer produces a stream of tokens with span information for error reporting.

#### 3.2 Parser (✅ Complete)

The parser is implemented in `src/turbulance/parser.rs` using a recursive descent approach. It builds a complete AST from the token stream and includes:

- Function declarations
- Project declarations
- Source declarations
- Statements (within, given, ensure, etc.)
- Expressions
- Error handling with descriptive messages

The parser handles all the Turbulance syntax features described in the language specification.

#### 3.3 AST (✅ Complete)

The AST definition in `src/turbulance/ast.rs` provides a comprehensive representation of Turbulance programs, including:

- Declarations (functions, projects, sources)
- Statements (within, given, ensure, etc.)
- Expressions (binary, unary, function calls)
- Text operations
- Literal values
- Position information for error reporting

#### 3.4 Interpreter (✅ Complete)

The interpreter is now fully implemented in `src/turbulance/interpreter.rs`. This component:
- Executes AST nodes
- Evaluates expressions (binary, unary, function calls)
- Evaluates control flow statements (if expressions, blocks)
- Handles variable assignments and lookups
- Implements scoping rules and closures
- Supports Turbulance-specific features:
  - Within blocks for operating on text units
  - Given blocks for conditional execution
  - Ensure statements for assertions
  - Text operations like simplify, expand, formalize, etc.

The interpreter includes comprehensive unit tests for all major language features and handles errors appropriately with descriptive messages.

#### 3.5 Standard Library (✅ Complete)

The standard library provides built-in functions for Turbulance scripts. It is now fully implemented, including:
- Text analysis functions (readability_score, contains, extract_patterns)
- Text transformation functions (simplify_sentences, replace_jargon)
- Research and knowledge integration functions (research_context, ensure_explanation_follows)
- Utility functions (print, len, typeof)

Each function has been implemented with comprehensive parameter validation, error handling, and detailed functionality:

1. `readability_score` - Analyzes text complexity and returns a numeric score
2. `contains` - Checks if text contains specific patterns
3. `extract_patterns` - Uses regex to extract matching patterns from text
4. `research_context` - Provides domain-specific contextual information
5. `ensure_explanation_follows` - Verifies or adds explanations after technical terms
6. `simplify_sentences` - Transforms complex sentences into simpler ones with configurable levels
7. `replace_jargon` - Substitutes domain-specific jargon with plain language alternatives
8. `print`, `len`, `typeof` - Standard utility functions for debugging and data manipulation

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests for all functions.

### 4. Text Unit Processing

#### 4.1 Boundary Detection (✅ Complete)

The boundary detection module in `src/text_unit/boundary.rs` is fully implemented. It provides:

- Comprehensive detection of all text unit types:
  - Character boundaries using Unicode grapheme clusters
  - Word boundaries with proper space handling
  - Sentence boundaries with improved heuristics (handling quotes, abbreviations, etc.)
  - Paragraph boundaries using configurable delimiters
  - Section boundaries with regex-based header detection
  - Document boundaries for encompassing all content
  - Semantic boundaries based on topic coherence and topic shift indicators
  - Custom boundaries defined via regular expressions

- Advanced features:
  - Hierarchical boundary organization
  - Metadata preservation
  - Configurable detection options
  - Coherence calculation between text units
  - Support for user-defined custom boundaries

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests for all boundary types and hierarchical structuring.

#### 4.2 Text Operations (✅ Complete)

The text operations module in `src/text_unit/operations.rs` is fully implemented. It provides:

- Core mathematical operations:
  - Division: Split text into semantic units with precise boundary detection
  - Multiplication: Combine text units with appropriate transitions
  - Addition: Concatenate text units with intelligent joining
  - Subtraction: Remove elements while preserving coherence

- Advanced text transformations:
  - Simplification: Multiple levels of text simplification
  - Formalization: Convert casual text to formal style
  - Expansion: Add explanatory details
  - Summarization: Create concise summaries
  - Normalization: Standardize formatting

  - Readability-based filtering
  - Position-based filtering (first, last, indexed)
  - Regular expression matching

- Pipeline processing:
  - Chain multiple operations together
  - Compose text units with intelligent transitions based on style
  - Error handling throughout the pipeline

The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests for all operations and complex transformations.

## Current Implementation Details

Here's the current state of key implementation files:

### main.rs

The main entry point is implemented with command-line argument parsing and command routing:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Initialize environment
    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    env_logger::init();
    
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    
    match cli.command {
        Commands::Run { script } => {
            run_script(&script)?;
        },
        Commands::Validate { script } => {
            validate_script(&script)?;
        },
        Commands::Process { document, interactive } => {
            process_document(&document, interactive)?;
        },
        Commands::Repl => {
            start_repl()?;
        },
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### src/turbulance/lexer.rs

The lexer is fully implemented with comprehensive token types:

```rust
#[derive(Logos, Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub enum TokenKind {
    // Keywords
    #[token("funxn")]
    FunctionDecl,

    #[token("project")]
    ProjectDecl,

    // Many more tokens defined...

    // Error handling
    #[error]
    Error,
}
```

### src/turbulance/parser.rs

The parser implements a complete recursive descent parser for Turbulance:

```rust
impl Parser {
    pub fn parse(&mut self) -> Result<Node, TurbulanceError> {
        let mut statements = Vec::new();
        
        while !self.is_at_end() {
            statements.push(self.declaration()?);
        }
        
        // Create a span for the entire program
        let start_pos = if let Some(first_token) = self.tokens.first() {
            Position::new(0, 0, first_token.span.start)
        } else {
            Position::new(0, 0, 0)
        };
        
        let end_pos = if let Some(last_token) = self.tokens.last() {
            Position::new(0, 0, last_token.span.end)
        } else {
            Position::new(0, 0, 0)
        };
        
        let span = Span::new(start_pos, end_pos);
        
        Ok(ast::program(statements, span))
    }
    
    // Many more parsing methods defined...
}
```

## Testing Strategy

The current testing approach uses unit tests for individual components. As implementation progresses, we need to:

1. **Expand Unit Test Coverage**

   - Test edge cases in text operations
   - Test error handling

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction between components
