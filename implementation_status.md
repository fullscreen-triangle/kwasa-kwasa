    dotenv::dotenv().ok();
    env_logger::init();
    
    let cli = Cli::parse();
    
    match cli.command {
        Commands::Run { script } => {
            run_script(&script)?;

    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### src/turbulance/lexer.rs

        let mut statements = Vec::new();
        
        while !self.is_at_end() {
            statements.push(self.declaration()?);
        }
        
        // Create a span for the entire program
        let start_pos = if let Some(first_token) = self.tokens.first() {
            Position::new(0, 0, first_token.span.start)
        } else {
            Position::new(0, 0, 0)
        };
        
        let end_pos = if let Some(last_token) = self.tokens.last() {
            Position::new(0, 0, last_token.span.end)
        } else {
            Position::new(0, 0, 0)
        };
        
        let span = Span::new(start_pos, end_pos);
        
        Ok(ast::program(statements, span))
    }
